# MLH INIT Bootsrap Starter Kit

This is my starter kit made during MLH INIT 2022 that uses Bootstrap to create a website.
If you clone it, it will give you a basic Bootstrap project that you can use for a hackathon!  

**Feel free to edit!**  
*This is just a guide to show how a Bootstrap page is put together*.

## How To Use

- Clone repo or download .zip file to computer.  
    - If you download the .zip file, decompress it.  
- Open the folder in any code editor. (I used vscode)
- If you ever want to check on your webpage, drag the index.html file  
    into a browser to see your creation. Whenever you save changes, either  
    drag it again or just refresh the one you already dragged!
